                                    <p>GST is known as the Goods and Services Tax. It is an indirect tax which has replaced many indirect taxes in India such as the excise duty, VAT, services tax, etc. The Goods and Service Tax Act was passed in the Parliament on 29th March 2017 and came into effect on 1st July 2017.</p>
                                    <p>In other words,Goods and Service Tax (GST) is levied on the supply of goods and services. Goods and Services Tax Law in India is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition. GST is a single domestic indirect tax law for the entire country.</p>
                                    <p>Before the Goods and Services Tax could be introduced, the structure of indirect tax levy in India was as follows:</p>
                                    <img src="CT_images/gst1.png" alt="gst image">
                                    <p>Under the GST regime, the tax is levied at every point of sale. In the case of intra-state sales, Central GST and State GST are charged. All the inter-state sales are chargeable to the Integrated GST.</p>
                                    <p>Now, let us understand the definition of Goods and Service Tax, as mentioned above, in detail.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2 style="margin: 40px 0px 30px; font-size: 36px; color: rgb(49 66 89/1);">Multi-stage</h2>
                                    <p>An item goes through multiple change-of-hands along its supply chain: Starting from manufacture until the final sale to the consumer.</p>
                                    <p>Let us consider the following stages:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Purchase of raw materials</li>
                                        <li>Production or manufacture</li>
                                        <li>Warehousing of finished goods</li>
                                        <li>Selling to wholesalers</li>
                                        <li>Sale of the product to the retailers</li>
                                        <li>Selling to the end consumers</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <img src="CT_images/gst1.png" alt="">
                                    <p>The Goods and Services Tax is levied on each of these stages making it a multi-stage tax.</p>
                                    <h2 style="margin: 40px 0px 30px; font-size: 36px; color: rgb(49 66 89/1);">Value Addition</h2>
                                    <img src="CT_images/gst2.png" alt="">
                                    <p>A manufacturer who makes biscuits buys flour, sugar and other material. The value of the inputs increases when the sugar and flour are mixed and baked into biscuits.</p>
                                    <p>The manufacturer then sells these biscuits to the warehousing agent who packs large quantities of biscuits in cartons and labels it. This is another addition of value to the biscuits. After this, the warehousing agent sells it to the retailer.</p>
                                    <p>The retailer packages the biscuits in smaller quantities and invests in the marketing of the biscuits, thus increasing its value. GST is levied on these value additions, i.e. the monetary value added at each stage to achieve the final sale to the end customer.</p>
                                    <h2 style="margin: 40px 0px 30px; font-size: 36px; color: rgb(49 66 89/1);">Destination-Based</h2>
                                    <p>Consider goods manufactured in Maharashtra and sold to the final consumer in Karnataka. Since the Goods and Service Tax is levied at the point of consumption, the entire tax revenue will go to Karnataka and not Maharashtra.</p>
                                    <h2 style="margin: 40px 0px 30px; font-size: 36px; color: rgb(49 66 89/1);">2. The Journey of GST in India</h2>
                                    <p>The GST journey began in the year 2000 when a committee was set up to draft law. It took 17 years from then for the Law to evolve. In 2017, the GST Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. On 1st July 2017, the GST Law came into force.</p>
                                    <img src="CT_images/gsthistory.png" alt="">
                                    <h2 style="margin: 40px 0px 30px; font-size: 36px; color: rgb(49 66 89/1);">3. Objectives Of GST</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="color: rgb(49, 66, 89);; font-weight: 600;">To achieve the ideology of ‘One Nation, One Tax’  </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>GST has replaced multiple indirect taxes, which were existing under the previous tax regime. The advantage of having one single tax means every state follows the same rate for a particular product or service. Tax administration is easier with the Central Government deciding the rates and policies. Common laws can be introduced, such as e-way bills for goods transport and e-invoicing for transaction reporting. Tax compliance is also better as taxpayers are not bogged down with multiple return forms and deadlines. Overall, it’s a unified system of indirect tax compliance.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="color: rgb(49, 66, 89);; font-weight: 600;">To subsume a majority of the indirect taxes in India </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>India had several erstwhile indirect taxes such as service tax, Value Added Tax (VAT), Central Excise, etc., which used to be levied at multiple supply chain stages. Some taxes were governed by the states and some by the Centre. There was no unified and centralised tax on both goods and services. Hence, GST was introduced. Under GST, all the major indirect taxes were subsumed into one. It has greatly reduced the compliance burden on taxpayers and eased tax administration for the government.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="color: rgb(49, 66, 89);; font-weight: 600;">To eliminate the cascading effect of taxes </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>One of the primary objectives of GST was to remove the cascading effect of taxes. Previously, due to different indirect tax laws, taxpayers could not set off the tax credits of one tax against the other. For example, the excise duties paid during manufacture could not be set off against the VAT payable during the sale. This led to a cascading effect of taxes. Under GST, the tax levy is only on the net value added at each stage of the supply chain. This has helped eliminate the cascading effect of taxes and contributed to the seamless flow of input tax credits across both goods and services.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="color: rgb(49, 66, 89);; font-weight: 600;">Online procedures for ease of doing business  </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Previously, taxpayers faced a lot of hardships dealing with different tax authorities under each tax law. Besides, while return filing was online, most of the assessment and refund procedures took place offline. Now, GST procedures are carried out almost entirely online. Everything is done with a click of a button, from registration to return filing to refunds to e-way bill generation. It has contributed to the overall ease of doing business in India and simplified taxpayer compliance to a massive extent. The government also plans to introduce a centralised portal soon for all indirect tax compliance such as e-invoicing, e-way bills and GST return filing.</p>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>A single indirect tax system reduces the need for multiple documentation for the supply of goods. GST minimises transportation cycle times, improves supply chain and turnaround time, and leads to warehouse consolidation, among other benefits. With the e-way bill system under GST, the removal of interstate checkpoints is most beneficial to the sector in improving transit and destination efficiency. Ultimately, it helps in cutting down the high logistics and warehousing costs.</p>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Introducing GST has also led to an increase in consumption and indirect tax revenues. Due to the cascading effect of taxes under the previous regime, the prices of goods in India were higher than in global markets. Even between states, the lower VAT rates in certain states led to an imbalance of purchases in these states. Having uniform GST rates have contributed to overall competitive pricing across India and on the global front. This has hence increased consumption and led to higher revenues, which has been another important objective achieved.</p>

                                    <p>GST has mainly removed the cascading effect on the sale of goods and services. Removal of the cascading effect has impacted the cost of goods. Since the GST regime eliminates the tax on tax, the cost of goods decreases.</p>
                                    <p>Also, GST is mainly technologically driven. All the activities like registration, return filing, application for refund and response to notice needs to be done online on the GST portal, which accelerates the processes.</p>

                                    <p>There are three taxes applicable under this system: CGST, SGST & IGST.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>CGST:</strong>It is the tax collected by the Central Government on an intra-state sale (e.g., a transaction happening within Maharashtra)</li>
                                        <li><strong>SGST:</strong>It is the tax collected by the state government on an intra-state sale (e.g., a transaction happening within Maharashtra)</li>
                                        <li><strong>IGST:</strong>It is a tax collected by the Central Government for an inter-state sale (e.g., Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In most cases, the tax structure under the new regime will be as follows:</p>
                                    <img src="CT_images/gst3.png" alt="">
                                    <h2 style="margin: 40px 0px 30px; font-size: 36px; color: rgb(49 66 89/1);">6. Tax Laws before GST</h2>
                                    <p>In the earlier indirect tax regime, there were many indirect taxes levied by both the state and the centre. States mainly collected taxes in the form of Value Added Tax (VAT). Every state had a different set of rules and regulations.</p>
                                    <p>Inter-state sale of goods was taxed by the centre. CST (Central State Tax) was applicable in case of inter-state sale of goods. The indirect taxes such as the entertainment tax, octroi and local tax were levied together by state and centre. These led to a lot of overlapping of taxes levied by both the state and the centre.</p>
                                    <p>For example, when goods were manufactured and sold, excise duty was charged by the centre. Over and above the excise duty, VAT was also charged by the state. It led to a tax on tax effect, also known as the cascading effect of taxes.</p>
                                    <p>The following is the list of indirect taxes in the pre-GST regime:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Central Excise Duty</li>
                                        <li>Duties of Excise</li>
                                        <li>Additional Duties of Excise</li>
                                        <li>Additional Duties of Customs</li>
                                        <li>Special Additional Duty of Customs</li>
                                        <li>Cess</li>
                                        <li>State VAT</li>
                                        <li>Central Sales Tax</li>
                                        <li>Purchase Tax</li>
                                        <li>Luxury Tax</li>
                                        <li>Entertainment Tax</li>
                                        <li>Entry Tax</li>
                                        <li>Taxes on advertisements</li>
                                        <li>Taxes on lotteries, betting, and gambling</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>CGST, SGST, and IGST have replaced all the above taxes.</p>
                                    <p>However, certain taxes such as the GST levied for the inter-state purchase at a concessional rate of 2% by the issue and utilisation of ‘Form C’ is still prevalent.</p>
                                    <p>It applies to certain non-GST goods such as:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Petroleum crude;</li>
                                        <li>High-speed diesel</li>
                                        <li>Motor spirit (commonly known as petrol);</li>
                                        <li>Natural gas;</li>
                                        <li>Aviation turbine fuel; and</li>
                                        <li>Alcoholic liquor for human consumption.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>It applies to the following transactions only:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Resale</li>

                                        <li>Use in certain sectors such as the telecommunication network, mining, the generation or distribution of electricity or any other power sector</li>
